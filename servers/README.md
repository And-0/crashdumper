Servers
======


These are all the official server-side implementations that can receive CrashDump data from CrashDumper. 
If you would like to add an implementation, we would be happy to receive a pull request!

## nodejs
This implementation was generously provided by [misterpah](http://github.com/misterpah), originally written as [crashdumper-logger](https://github.com/misterpah/crashdumper-logger). It uses NodeJS and can run on both localhost and a remote server.
